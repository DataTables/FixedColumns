		This method is either a getter or a setter for the number of columns that are fixed to the right of the table. If no argument is supplied then the method acts as a getter. If an argument is provided then that value is set as the new number of columns to be fixed to the right and the table is updated.

		As of FixedColumns 5 this method is text direction aware and will fix columns at the right hand side of the table regardless of text direction.
