		<description>
			As of FixedColumns 4.0.0 this option has been replaced by the `-init fixedColumns.left` option. There is no behaviour change here, but the naming is an improvement.

			For now this option will continue to be supported, however it will be removed in the future. We encourage you to move instead to `-init fixedColumns.left`.

	<type type="integer">
		<description>
			The number of columns on the left hand side of the table to fix in place.

	</type>

	<default value="1">
		The first column on the left of the table will be fixed in place.
	</default>

	<description>
		FixedColumns, by default, will fix only the left most column in place, however it is also possible to fix two or more columns in place as required by your application. The number of columns to fix in place is defined by this parameter, which is simply an integer that indicates how many columns should be fixed. FixedColumns will then use this value to fix that many _visible_ columns to the left side of the table. Columns that are not visible will be ignored.

		This option is deprecated and is replaced by the `-init fixedColumns.left` option.
